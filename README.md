##RISC V
RISC-V is an open-source, royalty-free instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of reduced instruction set computing (RISC). It was developed at UC Berkeley and has gained widespread adoption due to its flexibility, modularity, and openness.
###Key Features of RISC-V
Open-Source & Free: No licensing fees, allowing anyone to develop and modify processors.
Modular ISA: Comes in base integer variants (e.g., RV32I, RV64I) with optional extensions (e.g., M for multiplication, A for atomic operations, F for floating-point, etc.).
Scalability: Can be used in embedded systems, IoT devices, AI accelerators, and high-performance computing.
Growing Ecosystem: Supported by organizations like RISC-V International, with hardware implementations from companies like SiFive, Andes, and Ventana.
###Common RISC-V Implementations
SiFive Freedom Processors (Used in embedded and industrial applications)
ESP32-C3 (Espressif’s RISC-V-based Wi-Fi + BLE microcontroller)
HiFive Unmatched & Unleashed (Development boards for high-performance applications)
StarFive VisionFive 2 (RISC-V-based single-board computer)
